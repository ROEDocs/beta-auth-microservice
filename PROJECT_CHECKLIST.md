## Notes

This project implements a FastAPI application with Google OAuth authentication. It includes JWT token-based authentication with refresh tokens, and provides a simple UI for testing the authentication flow.

The application structure follows a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns between controllers, models, and endpoints.
